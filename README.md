# Devlog Entry - 11/15/24

The Team:
Tools Lead: Brian Feng
Engine Co-Lead: Eion Ling
Engine Co-Lead: Connor Lowe
Design Co-Lead: Charlize Serrano
Design Co-Lead: Annie McKay 

Tools & Materials:
  Our main engine that we plan to use is Unity. We chose to use this since we’re all the most familiar with working with it from other classes. We also believe that we can expand on the game more using a game engine rather than using just a coding language.
  We’ll be scripting in C# within Unity. We feel more confident coding in C# than typescript, since for most of us this is the first time we used typescript. The unity engine also natively supports C# so it is the go to after we picked our engine.
  We chose to use VSCode for our IDE because we are all familiar with it from using it in this class, and the plugins will be useful for keeping a consistent coding style. For art we will use aseprite. We chose to make our game with pixel art because it’s easy to have a consistent style across artists, and we believe that it is easier to animate pixel art sprites than 3D or hand drawn sprites.
  For our alternate platform of choice we will either be using Godot since it is a formal game engine or a Javascript web game. Preferably our team is leaning more towards the Godot side despite our lack of experience in it, just to have more of a game feel rather than create a browser game.

Outlook:
  We’re hoping to learn more about creating games in a group setting and becoming familiar with using these tools with multiple people. I think the hardest and riskiest part of the project is coordinating our coding. Some of our parts of the project relies on a teammate’s code. We also cannot have 2 people working on the same part of the project otherwise conflicts may occur.
  For a spin on our game, we were thinking we would take the general game loop and turn it into a deck builder. We would start out with a base pack of cards and a small grid and as the player progresses they unlock new seeds to obtain. While we would maintain the general game loop of a person going over tile-grids and planting, the player-view would be top down with a hand of cards at the bottom of the screen. To play a hand the player will move around and place a selected card on the open grid, which would apply to the ground in front of them.
