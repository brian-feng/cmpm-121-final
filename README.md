# Devlog Entry - 11/15/24

# The Team:
Tools Lead: Brian Feng
Engine Co-Lead: Eion Ling
Engine Co-Lead: Connor Lowe
Design Co-Lead: Charlize Serrano
Design Co-Lead: Annie McKay 

# Tools & Materials:
  Our main engine/framework that we plan to use is TypeScript + HTML5. We chose to use this since we’re familiar with working with it from this CMPM 121 class. 
  We’ll be scripting in TypeScript + HTML5. We've coded in Typescript for this entire class, so we will be able to fulfill our requirements. 
  We chose to use VSCode for our IDE because we are all familiar with it from using it in this class, and the plugins will be useful for keeping a consistent coding style. For art we will use aseprite. We chose to make our game with pixel art because it’s easy to have a consistent style across artists, and we believe that it is easier to animate pixel art sprites than 3D or hand drawn sprites.
  For our alternate platform of choice we will be using TypeScript + ThreeJS to Adam's recommendation! Our goal is to create a reasonably scoped browser game within these next couple of weeks.

# Outlook:
  We’re hoping to learn more about creating games in a group setting and becoming familiar with using these tools with multiple people. I think the hardest and riskiest part of the project is coordinating our coding. Some of our parts of the project relies on a teammate’s code. We also cannot have 2 people working on the same part of the project otherwise conflicts may occur.
  For a spin on our game, we were thinking we would take the general game loop and turn it into a deck builder. We would start out with a base pack of cards and a small grid and as the player progresses they unlock new seeds to obtain. While we would maintain the general game loop of a person going over tile-grids and planting, the player-view would be top down with a hand of cards at the bottom of the screen. To play a hand the player will move around and place a selected card on the open grid, which would apply to the ground in front of them.
